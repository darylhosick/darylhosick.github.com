# OTHER DRAWING SKILLS. UNDERSTANDING "WHY THINGS LOOK THE WAY THEY DO" and "LEARNING TO SEE THE CLUES"

Another skill that every artist should master is to learn "why things look the way they do". For example, understanding:

* Why some scenes appear flat while other appear to have depth.
* Why some roads appear to be level while other appear to be going up hill.
* Why the model's arm appear shorter when pointed toward you.

The study of understanding "why things look the way they do" is often referred to as "perspective" but it is really just another aspect of "seeing and drawing what is in front of you".

Unfortunately the study of "perspective" is often approached as a somewhat scientific subject -- learning rote boring "rules" that often do not even seem applicable to making art. Fortunately there is a better way -- learn to "understand why things look the way they do". The "perspective" part follows naturally.

* Understanding leads you to better "seeing".
* Better seeing allows you to see the clues - for example see "why the road appears to go up hill".
* When you learn to see why the road appears to go up hill it is easy to draw the road so that it
appears to go up hill.
