# TRADITIONAL DRAWING SKILLS

Traditional drawing instruction emphasizes transferring "what you see", proportions and shapes, onto your canvas. Thousands of art students participate in life drawing classes to hone their skills and abilities to see shapes and proportions. They use techniques such as holding a pencil at arm length to get the proportions just right or hold the pencil level to estimate angles. Some artists use photos and a grid system to transfer the reference material onto the canvas. Mastering this skill -- transferring proportions and shapes to you drawing -- is essential for all artists.
