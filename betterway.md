  <p class="lead">Learn to really understand "why thing look the way they do"</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Understanding leads you to better "seeing".</li>
    <li>Better seeing allows you to see the clues - for example see "why the road appears to go up hill" or "why the road appears to go down hill"</li>
    <li>When you learn to see why the road appears to go up or down hill it is easy to draw the road so that it appears to go up or down hill.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="lead">The neat thing is that once you understand why the road appears to go up hill or downhill -- it is easy to draw the road to appear to go uphill or downhill. The "perspective part" follows naturally.</p>
  <p class="lead">And the interesting thing about this "perspective" idea is that you subconsciously use perspective everyday. You look at the path ahead and subconsciously estimate how steep it is -- or judge how far you have to walk to get to the next street corner. All you have to do to capture these effects in your painting is to train yourself to be consciously aware of the perspective that you see and use everyday.</p>
