# UNDERSTAND -- IDENTIFY CLUES -- MAKE YOUR DRAWING

The interesting thing about this "perspective" idea is that you subconsciously use perspective everyday. You look at the path ahead and subconsciously estimate how steep it is -- or judge how far you have to walk to get to the next street corner. All you have to do to capture these effects in your painting is to train yourself to be consciously aware of the perspective that you see and use everyday.

We Are Offering a 60 minute VIDEO that uses this new approach so that you can learn these skills. The VIDEO will give you the power to:

* CONSCIOUSLY SEE AND UNDERSTAND "WHY THINGS LOOK THE WAY THEY DO"
* "SEE" THE "PERSPECTIVE CLUES"
* CAPTURE THESE EFFECT IN YOUR DRAWING OR PAINTING

AND - as an added bonus a comprehensive workbook is available so that you can practice and really learn your new skills
